Glimmer is a Minecraft shaderpack designed to be simple and performant without looking like it.

## Features
- 'Potato', 'Toaster', 'Integrated Graphics' and 'Dedicated Graphics' presets, designed to run on anything from your fridge to a NASA supercomputer.
- Complete LabPBR 1.3 compliance.
- Distant Horizons support!
- 'Infinite Ocean', adding water stretching out of render distance.
- Shadows, using either the shadow map or approximated from the lightmap.
- Screen space reflections and refractions.
- Procedural 2D clouds.
- Temporal filtering to reduce noise at low sample counts.
- Bloom.

## Compatibility
- OpenGL 4.3+ - macOS is *not* supported, nor is the Raspberry Pi. Most modern GPUs (integrated or dedicated) should work fine.
- Iris 1.6+, Optifine is *not* supported.
